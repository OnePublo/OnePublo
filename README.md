- 👋 Hi, I’m Sammy B 
- 👀 I’m interested in building a Webflow and marketing micro agency. One day, I hope to be able to work with Web 3.0 and become a proficient full-stack developer. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Webflow, Figma, SEO, and N8N. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on start-ups, vibe projects, and marketing.
